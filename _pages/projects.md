<h3>Anything British</h3>

![image-left](/images/anything-brit-header.png){: .align-left}

Applied Bayesian methods to explore the relationship between musical talent and national origin using <a href='https://mkt.tableau.com/Public/Datasets/Spotify_Daily_Streaming.csv.zip'> Spotify's Daily Streaming</a> dataset of 8.5M records. Features engineered by combining GCP's Custom Search Engine with <a href ='https://spacy.io/'> spaCy's </a> Named Entity Recognition (NER) feature.

<h3>Visualizing Markets with Natural Language Processing</h3>

![image-left](/images/app_screenshot2.png){: .align-left}

 Deployed a Flask app with Heroku to visually discover insights in the AI & Machine Learning startup market using Natural Language Processing. Using Crunchbase data, NLP and Dimensionality Reduction were applied to company descriptions / categories to create an interactive app to explore competitor proximity with Bokeh. Language preparation & processing utilized spaCy, NLTK, CountVectorizer, LDA, t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (T-SNE), and TfidfVectorizer.

<h3>Species Identification with Convolutional Neural Networks</h3>

![image-left](/images/deer.jpg){: .align-left}

<p>Applied convolutional neural networks with Keras / TensorFlow to compute regional species classification using imagery from Texas wildlife cameras and Microsoft Cognitive Services API. Data were stored in S3, <a href="https://rwmyers46.github.io/verify-labels-rekognition/">verified with AWS Rekognition</a>, processed on EC2 GPU, and presented with Tableau. The deployed model's functionality demonstrated text notifications to mobile devices using AWS SNS when species were positively identified.  </p>
